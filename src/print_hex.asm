[ORG 0x7c00]    ;   BIOS loads bootloader at physical address 0x7C00 and thus we tell the assembler to assemble instructions from that section

mov bp, 0x8000 ; Set the base of the stack a little above where BIOS loads our boot sector - so it won â€™t overwrite us.

    ;note that the hex value for ascii numbers starts at '0' = hex 30 and ends at '9' = hex 39 and the hex values for ascii lowercase letters starts at 'a' = hex 61 and ends at 'z' = hex 7a which we will use for number to string convertion

    mov cx, 0x4 ;16 bit hex values only contains 4 characters and thus we will use cx to convert each hex digit to corresponding ascii value for set digit

    sub cx, 0x1 ;decrement cx by 1

    mov ax, dx  ;copy dx into ax
    shr dx, 0x4 ; shift dx by 4 bits i.e remove the right most digit for example 0x1fb6 >> 0x4 becomes 0x01fb
    and ax, 0xf ;0xf in binary is 1111 and thus using the and operation will only give us the last 4 bits or the last hex digit: 0x1fb6 and 0xf -> 0x6

    mov bx, HEX_OUT
    add bx, 0x2       ;bx is at address where the first '0' in '0x0000' is located and adding 2 "skips" the '0x' part

    add byte [bx], 0x27  ;the 'byte' is a type specifier to tell the assembler we are adding a 8-bit number;ascii 'a' hex value is 0x61 so we add 0x27 so that we will end up adding 0x61 after we add the extra 0xa later since [bx] will only have the value 0x30 which is the ascii value for '0'

to_num:
    add word [bx], ax
